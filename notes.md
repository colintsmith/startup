# things I learned from creating my repository:
I learned that I can manage my repository from a console on my computer and how to push files to my online repository which is really helpful
I am also in the process of learning formatting syntax in these notes which I think is really interesting and am super hopeful that this works.

# notes on the history of the internet
First iteration of the internet was the ARPANET used for communicating between universities in preparation for a nuclear attack. In this two computers communicated directly without a single authority connecting them.  
Two big organizations manage the internet: the IETF and ICANN  
IETF = internet engineering task force  
ICANN = the Internet corporationof assigned names and numbers  





# HTML notes
We separate HTML into elements and tags. Text is okay and can be used as an element. A tag can enclose an element to specify what it is.  
Every HTML element can have attributes. Attributes go in tag brackets and the actual attribute can have quotation marks around it.  
Comments are surrounded by two dashes.
